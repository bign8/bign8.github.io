So, I finally realized that I gave out the wrong email for you guys to turn in homework to.  Below is the correct email!

Correct Email: <a href="mailto:Nathan.J.K.Woods@gmail.com" target="_blank">Nathan.J.K.Woods@gmail.com</a>

I apologize for the trouble and will extend the deadline until the next class period (Thursday, January 23rd).  Thanks for your cooperation.
