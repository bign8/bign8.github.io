For those that missed class last Thursday (the 23rd), Instead of going over "Day 3: While Loops," we reviewed all the content up to this point (Chapter 1 and Chapter 2).  Because of this schedule change, all the due dates have been pushed out until the end of this coming class period (Tuesday the 28th).

By having the programming exercises due two lab periods after they have been assigned should allow sufficient time to complete a majority of the content during our regularly scheduled lab time.  Also, this time is perfect to ask questions, especially if you do not completely understand the subject-matter.
<h4>Keep in mind:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>We will have a quiz over VL Chapter 2 at the beginning of class on Tuesday</li>
	<li>VL Chapter 2's programming exercises (the second homework assignment) will be due this Tuesday</li>
	<li>Read VL Chapter 3 for class on Tuesday</li>
	<li>Homework 1 has been graded (you should have received an email from me)</li>
	<li>Come with questions as necessary</li>
	<li>And as always, I am here to help!</li>
</ul>
