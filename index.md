## Elevator Speech

I am a freelance web developer, with hopes and aspirations of moving into the field of robotics.  Put simply, I'm a code monkey.  It's what I'm good at and I enjoy doing it.  Additionally, I have been told that I communicate complex ideas well with others, including the non-technical members of society.  Because of this, I work closely with my user base so they receive the best product / service possible.

I graduated from [Carroll College](cc) in 2013 with BA degrees in Mathematics and Computer science and a minor in Physics.  During undergrad I was a football player for the [Fighting Saints](fb), Meritorious winner for the [Mathematical Contest in Modeling](mcm), worked for Carroll's IT department in web development and was a Community Advisor, (Among [other](/about/) things).
