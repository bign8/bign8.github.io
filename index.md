# About Nathan J. Woods

To be completely honest, I am just another average person (with a blog). But unlike other people who go home to relax at night, I choose to go home and tinker, program, design, and break. Ever since I was young, I've taken things apart, attempted to understand how they work and possibly improve upon them. To be honest, I have no idea what I want to do, I just know what I'm good at and enjoy doing. And when it comes down to it, I pretty much enjoy anything to do with computers (hardware, firmware, or software). Through my undergraduate education, I have touched on every abstraction layer of the computer, from transistors to the human layer, and haven't found a layer yet that doesn't excite me.

## Who am I?

I am a freelance web developer, with hopes and aspirations of moving into the field of robotics.  Put simply, I'm a code monkey.  It's what I'm good at and I enjoy doing it.  Additionally, I have been told that I communicate complex ideas well with others, including the non-technical members of society.  Because of this, I work closely with my user base so they receive the best product / service possible.

I graduated from [Carroll College](http://www.carroll.edu/) in 2013 with BA degrees in Mathematics and Computer science and a minor in Physics.  During undergrad I was a football player for the [Fighting Saints](http://www.carroll.edu/athletics/football/), Meritorious winner for the [Mathematical Contest in Modeling](http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/), worked for Carroll's IT department in web development and was a Community Advisor.
