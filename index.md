# About Nate Woods

<p class="lead">
	I am a full-stack software developer with aspirations of moving into robotics.  I dive into problems, seek to understand the situation, derive execution plans and can realize those goals.  I communicate complex ideas well with others: technical and non-technical alike.  I work closely with my customers so they receive the best products and services possible.
</p>

I am a laid-back dude who tinkers, programs, designs, and hacks. I love to take things apart, discover how they work and improve them. I enjoy anything to do with computers (hardware, firmware, or software). Through my education and personal studies, I have touched on every abstraction layer of the computer, from silicon and transistors to user interfaces and the human layer, discovering joy throughout the stack.

### [US Patent 10325014: System and method for convergent document collaboration](/blog/2018/convergent-document-collaboration.html)

In various implementations, a computing device: displays the document outline on the user interface; maintains, in a non-transitory computer-readable medium, a causal graph data structure representing the document outline, wherein the causal graph data structure includes a plurality of structure nodes, each structure node representing a level of the document outline; receives, via the user interface, an insertion of a new level to the document outline; in response to the insertion, defines a structure node that represents the inserted level; inserts a transition node in the causal graph data structure, wherein the transition node represents a relationship between the structure node and at least one other node of the causal graph data structure; inserts the structure node into the causal graph data structure as a child of the transition node; and updating the user interface to display the inserted level.

### [ACM Conference Proceedings: The Causal Graph CRDT for Complex Document Structure](/blog/2018/causal-graph-crdt.html)

Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are an emerging tool for real-time collaborative editing. Existing work on CRDTs mostly focuses on documents as a list of text content, but large documents (having over 7,000 pages) with complex sectional structure need higher-level organization. We introduce the Causal Graph, which extends the Causal Tree CRDT into a graph of nodes and transitions to represent ordered trees. This data structure is useful in driving document outlines for large collaborative documents, resolving structures with over 100,000 sections in less than a second.

## Projects

All of my open source projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/bign8) or on my [self hosted git server](https://gogs.bign8.info/bign8).  These projects are personal discovery efforts or work that I have retrieved approval from employers to share with the world under my name.  But this is only what I am allowed to show or what I can do on my free time.  Just imagine how I can help your teams out if I was on your payroll, eh?
