Being an excessive tab user, I am often run out of memory on my machine. Realizing I need to close a few tabs (around 73) I do so, but that pesky flash memory just doesn't want to be returned to the operating system. The only way to free the used memory would be to close chrome completely, and lose all the opened tabs. The other option is to wait for Google to push an update and use the 'restart chrome to update' option. This works sometimes, but like the rest of America, waiting isn't really in my dictionary. Fortunately there is a way to restart the browser and save all your lovely tabs.

Simply navigate to `chrome://flags/` (sorry no link, chrome doesn't let you link to that page for security reasons).

This page has special permissions and can execute system calls to the browser itself.

From here there are multiple ways to restart the browser. Â The simplest of which is to click one feature twice (as to return to the enabled/disabled state it started in), and choosing the "Relaunch Now" button that appears at the bottom of the screen. After clicking, Chrome will save all your tabs, restart, and reload all your saved tabs. A nice little trick for the handbook!
