Alright, so a undergraduate thesis is not that big of a deal, but it is a fairly large undertaking.  I have spent a lot of time, already, working on this particular thesis, but I just started this blog so I will skip the early humanities of my thesis work.

Anyways, trying to utilize my work for as many classes as possible to reinforce my mathematical nature of being as lazy as possible, I created a [presentation](http://prezi.com/tuvt25p4d8fl/database-i-web-analytics/ "Web Statistics Database I Presentation") that shares my [database design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_design "Wikipedia - Database Design") along with a few thesis related goals.

Additionaly, I attempted to use [Prezi](http://prezi.com/ "Prezi")Â for this particular presentation in order to fit in with these cool, new and hip youngsters hanging around college campuses.
