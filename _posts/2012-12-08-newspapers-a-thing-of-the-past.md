Seen in the last page of today's Helena <del>Incorrect</del> [Independent Record](http://helenair.com/) is a half-page ad for the the quality information newspapers have to offer.  To prove this, the same ad shared a link to www.newspaperproject.org, which does not have anything to do with newspapers.  In fact, the domain was for sale.  Such a fine example of good, quality journalism.

*The following is the text of this half-page ad.*

### America's First Portable Information Device
>    The newspaper, yes the newspaper, is still America's best portable information device.  In these complex times, newspaper newsrooms continue to produce the most trusted journalism available anywhere, thanks to teams of dedicated, professional reporters and editors. That's why more than 100 million Americans pick up a newspaper every day.  So impress your family, friends and co-workers by enjoying the most portable, easy-to-use information device available anywhere.  No charger required.
