This install marks my second ever install of WordPress.  It seems as though these installs are getting even simpler that ever.  Maybe it's my experience in the field, or just a sign of all the other configurations I've completed, but things went fairly smoothly.  Just created a new database with an associated user; modified a line in by Apache configuration  and away things went! Still a little unhappy with the file permissions, but this should work for now.
