Now the Rot (or more currently, the S.T.A.C.) is already on my nerves from starting renovations 1 week before it began being used again (I will go into this later in another post) along with Linda Bahr sending a constant stream of All Student emails. So when I walk into the Rot on Wednesday this week to discover that there are no windows, letting in the 28°F air, I was less than pleased.

Attempting to eat without catching hypothermia should not be a problem of a college student a week away from finals (a stressful time).  Shivering the food off of my fork while I ate, I pondered the reasoning behind replacing the windows in the first place and why now?

Upon closer inspection of the windows that hadn't been replaced yet, there seemed to be no issues with them.  No cracks, no frame damage, nothing noticeable.  Which brings me to my second point, why now? If the windows were fine before, why must we replace them  now?

Clearly planning is not one of Carroll dining's strong suits!
