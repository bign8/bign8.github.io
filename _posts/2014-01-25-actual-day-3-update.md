For those that missed class last Thursday (the 23rd), Instead of going over "Day 3: While Loops," we reviewed all the content up to this point (Chapter 1 and Chapter 2).
Because of this schedule change, all the due dates have been pushed out until the end of this coming class period (Tuesday the 28th).

<!--more-->

By having the programming exercises due two lab periods after they have been assigned should allow sufficient time to complete a majority of the content during our regularly scheduled lab time.
Also, this time is perfect to ask questions, especially if you do not completely understand the subject-matter.


### Keep in mind

* We will have a quiz over VL Chapter 2 at the beginning of class on Tuesday
* VL Chapter 2's programming exercises (the second homework assignment) will be due this Tuesday
* Read VL Chapter 3 for class on Tuesday
* Homework 1 has been graded (you should have received an email from me)
* Come with questions as necessary
* And as always, I am here to help!
